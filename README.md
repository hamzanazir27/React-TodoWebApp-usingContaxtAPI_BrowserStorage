##   Learning Note

I built this project to improve my skills.

During development, I learned how to:

- Use `useState` and `useEffect` effectively
- Manage global state using React Context API
- Store and retrieve data with `localStorage`
- Build clean, reusable components
- Handle form inputs and manage user interaction
- Write better structured and maintainable code

This project helped me gain confidence in working with real-world React apps.
